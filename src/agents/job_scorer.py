Evaluate this job posting for the candidate:

{job_context}

Provide a comprehensive evaluation scoring the following dimensions (0-100):
1. Skills Match: How well do the candidate's skills match the requirements?
2. Experience Fit: Does the seniority level and experience align?
3. Salary Alignment: Is the compensation appropriate? (100 if unknown)
4. Culture Fit: Based on company description and role, does it match candidate preferences?
5. Growth Potential: Opportunities for learning and career advancement?
6. Commute Feasibility: Evaluate based on:
   - Job in Haarlem, Amsterdam, Leiden, or Hoofddorp = 100 (within 30min commute)
   - Remote or Hybrid = 100 (preferred work mode)
   - Fully on-site outside these cities = 20-40 (penalize heavily)
   - Look for keywords: "hybrid", "remote", "flexible", "home office"
   - Penalize: "5 days office", "fully on-site", "no remote"
7. Employment Type Fit: Is this an IN-HOUSE position? (CRITICAL - MUST BE 100 or 0-20)

   **STEP-BY-STEP LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS** (analyze the job description carefully):

   **STEP 1: Preposition Analysis (Dutch & English)**
   Check how "klanten/clients" is used in context:

   üö© CONSULTANCY indicators (Score 0-20):
   - Dutch: "bij klanten" (at clients), "bij onze klanten" (at our clients), "op locatie bij", "je werkt bij"
   - English: "at our clients", "at client sites", "at clients'", "you will work at"
   - If description says you work **AT/BIJ** clients ‚Üí CONSULTANCY ‚Üí Score 0-20

   ‚úÖ IN-HOUSE indicators (Score 100):
   - Dutch: "voor klanten bouwen we" (we build for customers), "met klanten werken" (work with customers)
   - English: "we build for clients", "serving our customers", "working with clients"
   - If description says you build/serve customers but work at own office ‚Üí IN-HOUSE ‚Üí Score 100

   **STEP 2: Work Location Analysis**
   Where does the actual work happen?

   üö© CONSULTANCY (0-20):
   - "op klantlocatie" (at client location)
   - "op projectbasis bij verschillende" (project-based at various)
   - "je wordt ingezet bij" (you are deployed at)
   - "at client premises", "on-site at client"

   ‚úÖ IN-HOUSE (100):
   - "op ons kantoor" (at our office)
   - "remote/thuiswerken" (remote/work from home)
   - "in ons team" (in our team)
   - "at our headquarters", "from our office"

   **STEP 3: Product/Project Ownership**
   Whose product or project are you working on?

   üö© CONSULTANCY (0-20):
   - "klantprojecten" (client projects)
   - "projecten voor opdrachtgevers" (projects for clients)
   - "deployed to client projects"

   ‚úÖ IN-HOUSE (100):
   - "ons eigen product" (our own product)
   - "ons platform" (our platform)
   - "voor ons bedrijf" (for our company)
   - "our product", "our platform", "our internal systems"

   **STEP 4: Explicit Red Flags**
   üö© Automatic 0-20 if found:
   - "detachering", "uitzenden", "inhuur" (staffing/temp work)
   - "consultancy", "secondment", "contracting", "staffing"

   **FINAL DECISION RULE (BE PRECISE - NO ASSUMPTIONS):**

   Score 0-20 ONLY if you find EXPLICIT evidence:
   - ‚úì "bij klanten", "bij onze klanten", "at clients", "at our clients"
   - ‚úì "op klantlocatie", "at client site", "client premises"
   - ‚úì "wordt ingezet bij", "deployed to clients"
   - ‚úì "detachering", "secondment", "staffing", "uitzenden"

   Score 100 if:
   - ‚úì "ons team", "our team", "ons product", "our platform"
   - ‚úì "in-house", "internal", "eigen team"
   - ‚úì No consultancy indicators found

   **CRITICAL: Do NOT infer consultancy from:**
   - ‚ùå Company name (many large companies have in-house AND consultancy divisions)
   - ‚ùå The word "projects" (in-house teams also work on projects!)
   - ‚ùå The word "klanten" alone (serving customers ‚â† working at clients)
   - ‚ùå Industry assumptions (banks, tech companies have in-house engineers!)

   **DEFAULT TO IN-HOUSE (100) unless you find EXPLICIT consultancy language in the description**

Also provide:
- Overall Score (weighted average: skills 25%, experience 20%, employment_type 25%, commute 15%, culture 10%, growth 5%)
- Match Highlights (3-5 specific reasons this is a good fit)
- Concerns (3-5 red flags or areas of mismatch, FLAG ANY CONSULTANCY INDICATORS)
- Decision (strong_match, potential, or pass)
- Summary (brief 2-3 sentence assessment)

Be honest and critical. A score of 60-70 is average, 80+ is excellent.

CRITICAL: Use linguistic analysis, NOT company blacklists!

Analyze the job description using the 4-step process above:
1. Check prepositions: "bij" (at) vs "voor" (for) vs "met" (with)
2. Identify work location: client site vs own office
3. Determine ownership: client projects vs own product
4. Look for explicit staffing/consultancy terms

Common mistakes to avoid:
‚ùå Don't reject based on "klanten" alone - context matters!
‚ùå Don't assume company name indicates consultancy - analyze the role description
‚úÖ DO look for "bij klanten", "at clients", "op klantlocatie"
‚úÖ DO check if they say "ons product" or "client projects"
